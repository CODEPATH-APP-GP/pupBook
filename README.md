### Description
The app will allow two profiles (The Pet Owner and The Pet Sitter). The feed on the application will consist of information about pets inputed by a Pet Owner. The Pet Sitter will  be able to the Pet Owner to question about the pet.  Could be potentially used as a service app for pet sitters.
